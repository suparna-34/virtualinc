== Description ==

I followed the instructions, I developed in the file "archive.php" a grid for the blogs.

To make the blog grid I created a "virtualinc.less" file to be able to work with my own styles without using the ".css" that comes by default.

I use javascript to be able to do the search function of the blogs, the search function uses the titles filtering the blog or blogs that are required.

== Installation ==

1. Download the project from github on your local machine.
2. The "virtualinc.sql" database can be installed using xampp or mamp with phpmyadmin on your local machine.
3. Using phpmyadmin, create an empty database named "virtualinc" and then import the ".sql" file.
4. If the import of the database is correct in "wp-options" make sure that the url "http://localhost:8888" has the correct port.
5. In the file "wp-config.php" make sure you have access to your mysql. example: "define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );" and "define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'root' );"
6. If everything is in order and you can run the project on your local machine, the access to wordpress is:

user: admin_virtual

pass: %yhDE2rmoa)VuVk6D*
